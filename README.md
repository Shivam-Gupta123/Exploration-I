# Exploration-I
The code written for the first exploration activity conducted using the Crayola Bots provided. The purpose of this exploration was to get exposure to the different devices such as sensors, servos, and motors that a design team might incorporate in the construction of a robot. This exploration allowed for the learning of skills such as calibrating a servo motor and controlling its angle using a CdS (Cadmium Sulfide) cell and using microswitches to help a robot navigate through a course.
